# Dog_breed_classification
In this project, I intend to recognize the breed of the dogs through data obtained from Kaggle and perform a thorough data analysis. Implemented using Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) model where the model is thoroughly trained and then analysis is performed. Jupyter notebook is used for the implementation of the model.
